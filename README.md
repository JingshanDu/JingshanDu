I am currently a [Washington Research Foundation](https://www.wrfseattle.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) working with [Dr. James J. De Yoreo](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/james-de-yoreo). I received my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering in 2021 from Northwestern University under the supervision of [Prof. Chad A. Mirkin](http://mirkin-group.northwestern.edu/) and [Prof. Vinayak P. Dravid](http://vpd.ms.northwestern.edu). In the same year, I received a Certificate for Management for Scientists and Engineers from the [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/management-scientists-engineers.aspx). In 2015, I received my B.S. in Engineering: Materials Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University Chu Kochen Honors College. I joined the State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials in early 2013 to work with [Prof. Hui Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhanghui) and [Prof. Deren Yang](http://silicongroup.zju.edu.cn/en/yangderen/). In summer 2014, I visited [Prof. Xiangfeng Duan's group](http://xduan.chem.ucla.edu/) at UCLA for two months. I was a visiting undergraduate in the [Weitz Lab](http://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences during October 2014 and May 2015. 

I am interested in a broad range of topics across materials science and chemical physics. Recently, my research has been focused on nanoscale phase transformation, complex nanoparticle systems, and correlative electron microscopy.
