I am a Staff Scientist in Materials Science at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) after serving as a [Washington Research Foundation](https://www.wrfseattle.org/) Postdoctoral Fellow. My research spans crystal formation and transformation pathways, in situ electron microscopy, and complex atomic configurations in nanostructures. I received a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in 2021. At Northwestern, I worked on complex nanoparticle systems, correlative electron microscopy of hybrid nanostructures, and nanoscale thermodynamics. I received a Certificate for Management for Scientists and Engineers from Northwesternâ€™s [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/management-scientists-engineers.aspx) in 2021 and a B.Sc. in Engineering from [Zhejiang University Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/) in 2015. 

I am an Associate Editor of [_Frontiers for Young Minds_](https://kids.frontiersin.org/) and a Community Board member of [_Nanoscale Horizons_](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/nanoscale-horizons/). I organized or chaired several conferences and symposia on the local and (inter)national levels. I was appointed a Ryan Fellow and received an Outstanding Research Award from the International Institute for Nanotechnology at Northwestern University.
